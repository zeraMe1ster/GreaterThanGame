# GreaterThanGame
Just a simple program that is played by pressing button where random numbers from 1 -  10 will be generated and the user needs to guess which one is greater and earn the score..


** Bugs **

1. This game ends even while the user have -10 score ( Note the round ends at 10 points method)
2. Same number might appear in both button yet the score will not be either added or deducted ( yet the algorithm was set not to generate this so thats a problem though).
